##Summary

Menu images allows you to have an interface in the admin section and on any nodes that populate this site. This module is very much in a beta stage, and should not be used on production sites unless you really know what you are doing.

##How It works

Fill out your menu information, if you add an image the image will show up.

##Notes on Compatibility

##Limitations

this only works with the secondary links and menu_block menus.

##Dependencies

##Road Map

In the future, this will have an admin interface, and options for creating carousel style navigation, but for right now this is an ALPHA release.

##Contacting the Maintainer of This project

Please feel free to contact me via github or drupal.org. My handle is "kirikintha" it's easy to find me. Support requests should allow between 3-5 business days, and I have to reserve the right to push off new features to the next version. My plan is to have quarterly releases, unless there is an emergency bug that crashes everything, which I will do my best to resolve as quickly as I can.

Thank you very much for using my module, I hope it works for you bug free!
